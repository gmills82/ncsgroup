 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Major Healthcare Company - Employee Retention</p>
 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Client</p>
A leading long-term healthcare provider located in the North Central United States

 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Challenge</p>
 The Client had a problem of integrating and retaining personnel from merged or acquired facilities 
 into the new parent corporation. Changes in employee benefits programs translated into lower employee
 retention rates across the country. Part of the solution for this Client included allowing the newly
 merged employees to continue with their current benefits package to minimize disturbance during the
 merge process; however, there were hundreds of facilities and scores of disparate benefits programs.
 Though cumbersome, the company was committed to maintaining all benefits programs.
  Because of open enrollment deadlines, there was a distinct possibility that the combination of
   these factors would overload their current system capacity with disastrous consequences for 
   payroll and benefits administration.
 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Solution</p>
  NCS consultants designed a benefits administration system across the corporate enterprise to accommodate the plethora of plans available to all employees. 

The NCS consulting team provided the following functions:
<ul>
<li>Fit gap analysis for transition from an outdated voice system to a new Web-based system. </li>
<li>Functional lead worked with Benefits, HR, and Payroll departments to design,&nbsp; re-engineer,
 and implement a benefit administration system for 60,000+ active employees from an existing 
 system consisting of union and non-union benefit programs. Total number of benefits programs:
  81.</li>
<li>On-site technical support for Client's IS Department staff to provide technical mentoring,
 knowledge transfer, and oversight in troubleshooting process flow errors typical to daily 
 execution of benefits administration.</li>
<li>Functional test plan and test execution for 81 benefit programs, 17 event classes, and
 7,000+ eligibility rules. </li>
</ul>
         <p class="caseStudyHeading">Results</p>
Despite extremely tight deadlines and budgets, the NCS consulting team designed, executed, 
implemented, and successfully tested the new system in 8 months. The number of follow-up issues
 after go-live was insignificant, and the Client was pleased with the system's ease of use for
  both benefits administrators and employees in the field. There was no interruption to employee
   payroll or benefits administration.
