 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Regional Insurance Provider  - System Conversion</p>
 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Client</p>
 Located in the south, this client is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies in the nation.
 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Challenge</p>
  The Client needed to quickly find a comprehensive provider with extensive Life70 experience as well as an extensive Life Insurance and Annuity background.  The Client was in the midst of a major system conversion and did not currently have any resources on staff with the time or knowledge to support the Life70 portion of this conversion.  The Client also needed resources to step in and research Life70 production issues. 
</p>

 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Solution</p>
 Leveraging vast expertise and best practices, NCS was able to dedicate 100% each day to analyzing and testing the Client's mainframe environment in preparation for a smooth conversion.  This solution increased efficiencies and decreased the time involved to deliver quality test results to the end users.

With refined testing processes in place, NCS was able to take on a more supportive role in the Quality Assurance Department, and was assigned many other departmental projects. 

The Client received the highest quality onsite service from NCS.
<p>  Specific services included:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-site analysis, testing solutions, and timely implementation of those solutions.</li>
<li>Regular reporting to management for onsite testing and analysis of all assigned projects.</li>
<li>On-going analysis and providing solutions to production issues.</li>
<li>On-going departmental project support.</li>
</ul>
NCS continues to provide services to the Client at the Client's corporate campus Monday through Friday and weekends as requested.

  </p>
        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Results</p>
<p> NCS's Business Analyst solution was a business success accomplishing all objectives and achieving 100% productivity each month. 
<p>Additional positive impacts on the Client's conversion effort included:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% satisfaction in numerous projects test results</li>
<li>Continuous 100% satisfaction rating from the client</li>
</ul>
