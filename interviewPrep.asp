      <p class="pageHeading">The Toughest Interview Questions </p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading"> Why do you want to leave your current job?</span><br>
     Don’t say anything negative about your current employer.  You might say that you are looking for new challenge.
</p>
<p>    
<span  class="categoryHeading">What are you looking for in a new job?</span><br> 
     Be honest.  Don't focus on money 
</p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading">What position do you want to have in the next 5-10 years?</span><br> 
     Be realistic. Look for reasonable progress with commensurate challenge. 
</p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading">What do you dislike the most about your current job?</span><br>  
     Be very positive.  Look to future "new challenges". 
</p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading">Have you applied with other companies?</span> <br>
     Be honest. 
</p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading">What interests you the most about this position?</span><br>  
     Very brief answer.   
</p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading">What income / salary are you expecting?</span><br>
     Money is not your primary motivation.   Salary should be commensurate with your experience.
</p>
<p>    
<span  class="categoryHeading">Tell me about yourself.</span><br>
  Ask what specific area they would like to know about. Avoid telling your life history.  Focus on your skills and the experience you have that will benefit the employer.
</p>
<p>    
<span  class="categoryHeading">Why do you want to work for this company?</span><br>
  Know about the company and structure your answer to fit.  
</p>
<p>    
<span  class="categoryHeading">What is your biggest weakness?</span><br>
  Turn into a positive.  "Sometimes impatient to get the job done", "Frustrated with laziness" "Work too much"
</p>
<p>    
<span  class="categoryHeading">What causes you to lose your temper?</span><br>
  Keep it bland, i.e. traffic, laziness or lateness.  Do not  get  into anything heavy.
</p>
<p>    
<span  class="categoryHeading">Who has been the most unforgettable influence in your life?</span>
<br>Don’t let any story go more than 3-4 minutes. 
</p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading">If you had your choice of jobs and companies, which would you choose?</span><br>
     Don’t give an answer that doesn’t fit the position you are interviewing for. 
</p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading">When can you start?</span> <br>
 When do you need me?  If you don’t give a reasonable notice to your current employer, future employers will fear similar treatment.
</p>
<p>    
<span  class="categoryHeading">How would you evaluate your current employer or manager?</span><br>
     NO negatives. 
</p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading">What is your biggest accomplishment in your current/last job?</span><br>  
      Be sure you have thought this question through. 
</p>
<p>
<span  class="categoryHeading">What interests you the most about this position?  The least?</span><br>    Know the position well before you answer this question.
