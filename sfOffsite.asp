<span>	It is not acceptable for any NCS External Associate to work off-site without prior approval by/from State Farm management via a formal request from NCS.  This includes all 'working from home' arrangements.</span>
<p> Due to the number of requests State Farm receives from individuals to work from home, an approval for anyone to work from home will be rare and must be supported by a formal request usually only if there is a sufficient business case or medical reason to justify their approval.  </p>
 
<p>This does not affect 'on-call' individuals.  </p>
 
<p>The current proposal is to no longer allow unapproved 'worked-from-home' hours to be included in payroll processing.  </p>
