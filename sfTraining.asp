        <p class="pageHeading">Training Requests </p>
<p>All requests for work-related training and/or educational classes are required to be coordinated by NCS and the External Staffing Unit.   The role of NCS is to facilitate approval for these requests.  The guidelines regarding these requests is as follows:</p>
 
<p>The Staffing Unit is required to approve all such requests and we are responsible for the submission of the request to them.   </p>
 
<p>Because the opportunity to gain approval is jeopardized when the Staffing Unit has not been included in the discussions leading up to the formal request, please provide Trish Hartman and/or Kenny Smith with as many details as soon as the discussion of a request begins.  Please keep us 'in the loop' as your discussions continue.  </p>
 
<p>If ever in doubt of whether to notify us, please know that we always prefer to receive too much information to not receiving enough information.  </p>
