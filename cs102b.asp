         The Client needed Project Managers with diverse knowledge to manage an upgrade of the Exchange messaging and collaboration platform while maintaining stability in the environment of over 125,000 mailbox users. <br><br> 

Exchange is a core technology within the Microsoft BackOffice suite.  In order to fully leverage the features and integration within Microsoft products, it was important for NCS to implement the major Microsoft product upgrades.  In implementing Exchange 2000, it would be possible to review and re-architect the email infrastructure from the ground up.  NCS decided to minimize risk and keep this project manageable by implementing Exchange 2000 by building on the Client's existing Exchange design, rather than starting over from scratch.  Important new features of Exchange 2000, such as its use of Active Directory, would require some architectural changes.
 </p>
        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Solution</p>
         NCS upgraded the Exchange messaging and collaboration platform while maintaining stability in the environment.  This project supports the following System's goals:
	<ul>
	<li>Ensure Client's products are among the best values to their respective markets.</li>
	<li>Deliver friendly and convenient service to our customers in a fair and prompt manner.</li>
	<li>Provide access to project/services in the time and manner of our customer's choice.</li>
	<li>Adopt a more segmented approach to the marketplace.</li>
	<li>Further leverage and build Client's brand.</li>
	<li>Manage expenses and processes to operate in an efficient, cost-effective manner.</li>
	<li>Ensure the protection of Client's assets by encouraging activities that support compliance principles.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Results</p>
       <ul>
	   <li>  NCS upgraded all Exchange servers in Production, Development, and Simulated Production environments to Exchange 2000.  This totaled approximately 225 servers and in excess of 125,000 mailboxes.</li>
	<li>NCS implemented this upgrade with little or no disruption to users.</li>
    <li>NCS implemented the infrastructure needed to allow Web access to email and public folders using secured Outlook Web Access.</li>

	<ul><li>Instant Messaging</li>
	<li>Chat</li> 
	<li>Data Conferencing</li></ul>
	<li>NCS evaluated architectural enhancements within Exchange 2000, and implemented those that will help increase availability and stability. Items evaluated included: </li>
    <ul>
	<li>Multiple stores</li>
	<li>Multiple storage groups</li>
	<li>Front-end/back-end servers</li> </ul>
