<p>When you arrive on State Farm property in your vehicle, please be aware there are many restricted parking areas provided by State Farm on State Farm property. </p>
<p>  There are also plenty of non-restricted parking spaces for the individuals that work at State Farm.</p>
<p>All parking areas at State Farm are monitored by on-site personnel and also via cameras. </p>
<p> Although the 2-hour Visitor Parking areas may be empty or they may be more convenient, these are considered to be restricted parking areas.</p>  
<p>Accordingly, anyone working at State Farm and parking in any designated Visitor Parking area is subject to receiving a ticket regardless of the length of time that person may have occupied the parking space.</p>
<p>  In simple terms, while it may convenient to park in the 2-hour Visitor Parking with the idea that one would then move his vehicle prior to the 2-hour time limit expiration, these areas  are designated as parking for visitors only, are not intended as temporary parking of individuals working at State Farm, and citations will be issued to violators that park in these areas for any length of time. </p>   
 <p>
Should you have any questions or need further explanation, please contact Kenny Smith at 800-854-0581 or 901-240-8676.</p>
