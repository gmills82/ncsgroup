 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Major Insurance Provider  - Quality Verification</p>
  <p class="caseStudyHeading">Client</p>
	   Multi-line insurance provider
 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Challenge</p>
       The Client wanted to add banking operations to their existing insurance operations. The goal was/is to capitalize on modern technology with minimal real estate holdings to maintain low operating expenses. This Client's desire was to operate as a Web-based financial services operation with no retail brick-and-mortar facilities.   The Client needed professional expertise with their IT systems requirements to complement their business objectives.
 
As a result of the need, NCS delivered business analysts with various expertises.  NCS business analysts experienced with project leading, project planning, accounting, banking, credit card, financial services, mortgage banking, and test coordination backgrounds were brought into the Client site to ensure the project maintain its course. 
 </p>

 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Solution</p>
       NCS provided the business analysts, testing coordinators, and the project lead individuals necessary to manage the success of this project.  Involvement in the Client's planning details prompted a mutual understanding of the Client's objectives and the role of NCS participation.  Software products were analyzed, tested, and reviewed by NCS business analysts and the software purchasing decisions were made based upon NCS recommendations.  A timeline was developed for the installation and the implementation of the various software and then staffing needs to support the software were developed.  Conversion of the software products to a proprietary format via licensing agreements was coordinated with the software vendors and the implementation began soon afterwards.  Completion of the implementation, testing, and rollout was over a period of 15 months.  The Client initiated their financial business services with an internal credit union to allow for the 'kinks' to be worked out over a one-year period and then moved forward with their financial service product services.  Systems support personnel including helpdesk individuals were added during this process.  
  </p>
        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Results</p>
<p>   NCS provided business analysts, project leads, testing coordinators, and helpdesk personnel throughout the entire process.  Now in its 5th year of operation, the financial services operation has proven to be extremely successful and NCS continues to provide business analysts, and support personnel to this Client for upgrades and maintenance of the Client's financial services business.
