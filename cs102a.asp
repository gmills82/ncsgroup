          This NCS Client had the desire to initiate a project as a strategic effort to improve their competitive advantage in the Homeowners/Personal Lines insurance business.  The Client's objective was to offer a claim-free discount on Homeowners policies per their actuarial underwriting standards.  

        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Solution</p>
          NCS designed, developed, and implemented the systems application software to support this   program for Client's Homeowners policies.  This project included the design, development, and implementation of an application for automated changes to the rating structure for the Homeowners line of business meeting underwriting criteria.  The application for this project also supported the incorporation of underwriting criteria for weather, non-weather, and catastrophe losses to be used for rating and underwriting purposes.<br><br>

        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Results</p>
          The design, development, and implementation of the application for this project generated the appropriate rates for Homeowners policies per this Client's guidelines.  NCS also developed a tracking application tool to record and monitor the Change Management process to determine potential reactions, issues, or training needs from the field.
