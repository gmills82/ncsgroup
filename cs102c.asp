	   <p class="caseStudyHeading">Challenge</p>
       The Client was in the midst of an ongoing phase of a company-wide initiative to automate applications and policies. The goal was to create a web-based framework to process new business application requests electronically from agent offices to the regional office. This initiative would result in greater functionality for a broad range of policy types.
<p>
The expansion of this functionality included automatic policy issuance for Homeowners, Renters, Condominium Unit owners, and Rental Dwelling policies (single location).  This included underwriter-reviewed applications that can be issued without any modifications.

 </p>
        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Solution</p>
        NCS Project Managers provided the ability to automatically issue policies meeting specified criteria developed for Homeowners, Renters, and Condominium unit owners. In addition single location Rental Dwelling policies were included.

<p>The Client business benefits gained with this completed effort:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Decreased the number of new hires needed to support policy growth</li>
	<li>Freed personnel to work on more challenging tasks</li>
	<li>Reduced average processing time by 20%</li>
    </ul>
This effort aligns with current broad business strategies:
	<ul>
	<li>Achieve unsurpassed customer satisfaction levels</li>
	<li>Offer employees/agents opportunities for growth</li>
	<li>Sustain long-term growth with quality</li>
	<li>Maintain financial stability</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Results</p>
		The Client would be able to:
   	<ul>
	<li>Automatically issue Fire policies</li>
	<li>Provide the ability to accept and issue application "as is" without going into Interactive Fire to enter the streamed screens</li> 
	<li>Provide the ability to go back and audit "system issued" policies </li> 
	<li>Provide regional office training</li>
</ul>
