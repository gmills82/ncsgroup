  <p class="caseStudyHeading">Client</p>

 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Challenge</p>
    As one of the largest privately owned networks in the world, the Client wished to centralize administration and security for thousands of users and customer information data files.
</p>

 <p class="caseStudyHeading">Solution</p>
  Migration to a common platform for network and user administration required thousands of remote office users to be authenticated through a central database of permitted access and rights records.  NCS would provide network and security administrators that would be required to design, initiate, and document procedures and practices for one of the largest migrations ever initiated. 
  </p>
        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Results</p>
<p>  NCS provided consultants that were part of the administration and security team.  Creation of the processes and troubleshooting problems that arose with the complex migration were a part of the daily requirements.
<ul>
<li>Allowing users across North America to access customers' files 24 hours a day and 365 days a year was imperative.  The security to authenticate the requests was a crucial part of the administrative task.</li> 
<li>Documented procedures were created from the experience supplied by the NCS team of consultants and the processes and administration procedures have become an implemented business structure.</li>
<li>NCS supplied experience and knowledge that contributed to one of the largest directory platform migrations ever undertaken by one of the largest information technology networks ever created.</li>
</ul>
