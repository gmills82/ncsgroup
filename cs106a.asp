	     <p class="caseStudyHeading">Client</p>
	   The client was a large manufacturing company, with approximately 300 facilities across the US and Canada, with 18,000+ employees.
	   <p class="caseStudyHeading">Challenge</p>
    The client had made a large capital investment in a new computerized maintenance management software package and associated hardware and wanted to get their larger mill facilities implemented as quickly as possible.  They hired a full time project manager and assistant, and put together a company team of power users from the mills to work with a vendor managed team to pilot the first two implementations, and then fully expected to utilize the power users to assist with future implementations.  Once the client was ready to begin the rapid roll out to mills, the project manager requested mill management teams to provide power users to assist, and the mills could not spare their power users to an implementation team.  The project manager was given four additional headcounts for the team, but they still needed more team members to assist with the implementations.  She shopped around for qualified consultants with acceptable hourly rates.

        <p class="caseStudyHeading">Solution</p>
      NCS provided qualified consultants at competitive rates to supplement the company team in implementing the software.

The NCS consultants were contracted on a monthly or yearly basis as needed.  The consulting team consisted of:
<ul>
<li>A Content and Data Conversion Manager that totally exceeded even our greatest expectations.   NCS worked with the client to transition this consultant from a full time contracted position with NCS to a full time employee of the client.  </li>
<li>A Systems Analyst with extensive knowledge of the application, the business and the touch points necessary for integrating to a corporate financial package.  This consultant worked on a sub-team that did a full integration to four corporate systems, one of which was SAP.</li>
<li>A Technical Analyst with extensive knowledge of PCs and LAN/WAN topology that was able to totally take control of all hardware and PC software necessary for a full-scale implementation at a plant.  He also built and maintains our current project team webpage and acts as a system support for mills as they are implemented.</li>
<li>Two Business Analysts that had full knowledge of the application and business work flows that were able to lead business process reviews and train new users on the application, as well as support respective data conversion efforts.</li>
</ul>   
    <p class="caseStudyHeading">Results</p>
   Currently, there are ten plants with 1400 users utilizing the application that NCS consultants helped to implement.  NCS consultants remain a vital part of the team that supports the application and works to continuously improve processes in and around the application.
